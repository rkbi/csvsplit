# Requirement

* All lists must be in csv format with a single column.
* There must be no quotation for the values eg. ```019xxxxxxxx``` instead of ```"019xxxxxxxx"```.


# How to use

* Rename the full list as ```full.csv```.
* Rename the complete list as ```done.csv```.
* Make sure all ```full.csv```, ```done.csv``` and ```script.php``` files are under the same directory.
* Set the ```LIMIT_PER_FILE``` value as you need to limit the numbers of each file.
* Run the ```script.php``` from browser or command line.
* The resulting ```remaining*.csv``` files are ready for reupload.
